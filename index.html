          <h3>More About Me</h3>
          <p>I’m currently studying in the Information Technology program at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School, where I’ve developed a strong interest in areas like web development, programming, and cybersecurity. I enjoy creating projects that blend creativity with logic, whether that means building interactive websites, exploring Python scripts, or analyzing how technology shapes the world around us. I’m always looking for ways to grow as a learner and team member—whether it's through hands-on labs, group collaborations, or self-guided learning. Outside of school, I like to [insert hobbies like draw, read sci-fi, work on tech builds, game, or explore space/science topics], and I’m passionate about turning ideas into things that actually work. In the future, I hope to pursue a career in [insert interest like software engineering, ethical hacking, data science, etc.], and I’m excited to see where this journey takes me.</p>
