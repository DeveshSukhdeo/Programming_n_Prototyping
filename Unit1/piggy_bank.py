# little Canadian kid broke their piggy bank
# you are to create a program to help them figure out how much money they have 
# pennies = 1 cent
# nickel = 5 cents 
# dimes = 10 cents 
# quarters = 25 cents 
# loonies = $1 or 100 cents 
# toonies = $2 or 200 cents
# ask the kid how many coins they have of each kind 
# calculate the total and give the answer in decimals and in a combination 
# i.e: $13.67 or $13 and 2 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickle, 2 cent.
