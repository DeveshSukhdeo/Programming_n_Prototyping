      <h2>Infy App Challenge Website: PyMasters</h2>
      <iframe src="https://deveshsukhdeo.github.io/InfyAppPyMasters/"></iframe>
      <p>This is the webiste for the Infy App Challenge. I worked with my group members Vashti and Rohaan to create an app with the goal of helping immigrants find jobs and get accustomed to their new community. The website shows our canva presentation, our figma mock up, a demo video and also some more details about our app. We presented during the semifinals but did not pass on.</p>

      <h2>G4C Game Hosting Page</h2>
      <iframe src="https://deveshsukhdeo.github.io/G4C-25/"></iframe>
      <p>This website shows the game I made for the Games 4 Change competition. It is a game about a samurai with the task of eliminating spirits that cause climate change while avoiding the good spirits. The website has the game embedded and also has additional information as to what the game is about and why I chose that topic.</p>
